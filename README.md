# A-single-image-deraining-algorithm-guided-by-text-generation-based-on-depth-information-conditions
Currently, high-resolution images generated by image denoising algorithms based on text-to-image diffusion models exhibit chaotic internal structural layouts, and their details differ from real images. To address these issues, we propose a single-image deraining algorithm guided by text generation based on depth information conditions. We designed a depth information encoder aimed at leveraging the depth information in rainy images to enhance the spatial mapping between text-to-image and image-to-text, thereby improving the internal structural layout of the generated images. To make the texture details of the generated image domain more similar to those of the original image domain, we designed a Cross Attention module that uses differential information to make the images in both domains more similar, thereby enhancing the guidance of existing deraining algorithms. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms mainstream image deraining algorithms in both visual quality and metrics across multiple datasets. We will publish our code after publishing the paper.
